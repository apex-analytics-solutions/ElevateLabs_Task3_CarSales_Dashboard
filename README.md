## 📊 Key Business Insights

Based on the analysis and the final dashboard design, the following strategic insights were generated:

* **Revenue Drivers:** Ford, Chevrolet, and Nissan are the dominant revenue drivers, accounting for a significant portion of the total market share.
* **Pricing Dynamics:** Sales volume and average selling price show a strong positive correlation, suggesting that a significant peak in early 2015 was driven by high market demand, not by discounting.
* **Geographic Focus:** Sales revenue is highly concentrated in specific regions (e.g., West and Southeast), indicating a need for region-specific inventory and marketing strategies.
